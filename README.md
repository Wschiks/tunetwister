**TuneTwister** is a fun Spotify-based game inspired by [HitsterGame](https://hitstergame.com/nl-nl/) and a previous school project in C# where we experimented with Spotify playback. This time, we finally got to play with the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) for real!
